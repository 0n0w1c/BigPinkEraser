# Big Pink Eraser

A tool to remove entities from a selected area, including invisible entities.

The Big Pink Eraser is primarily designed for cleaning up invisible entities caused by bugs or deactivated mods. However, it is equally effective at deleting other unwanted entities and items (ignores placed tiles).

### Selection Modes

* **Standard Mode (Left-Click):** Deletes buildings, items, ghosts, and invisible entities while preserving the natural landscape.

* **Alternate Mode (Shift + Left-Click):** Deletes what the standard mode ignores: trees, rocks, cliffs, biters, nests, and ground decoratives.

### Features
* **Startup Settings:** Customize the shortcut button (button color and image or clip art style).
* **Multi-player:** Multi-force aware, respects force ownership, and can be restricted to **Admins Only** via startup settings.

**Caution:** The actions performed with this tool are **not reversible** with "Undo." Use with care!
